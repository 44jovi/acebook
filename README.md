# Team Charter

**We are team Priceless**

Bearing in mind the EQ learning we‚Äôve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in.

**We plan to meet:**

- At 10am for morning standup (15min)
- Assign 1.5-day roles
- At 1.30pm for afternoon standup (15min)
- At 5pm for a retro at the end of the day

**We value:**

- Communication
- Honesty
- Growth
- Teamwork and Support (Slack channel, Retros)
- FUN!!!! (in that order)

**These roles rotate every 2 days:**

1. üëë**Scrum Master/Leader**

     - Makes sure everyone is working well together

2. ‚úçüèΩ**Scribe + Reporter/Helper**

   - Scribe + Reporter
     - Makes notes about group activities and meetings
     - Reports what the group is working on and has done, both within the team and externally
   - Helper
     - Looks out for members who have taken on too much as well as members who don‚Äôt have enough to do
     - Looks out for the health of other members, ensures they‚Äôre taking breaks
     - Finds ways to keep team motivation up and makes sure successes are celebrated

5. **Work Flows**

   - Pairing

     - Pull latest version of main
     - Check-out a new branch / existing branch for your ticket
     - Work in branch, and keep committing upstream
     - Merge latest main again before pull request to avoid merge conflicts
     - Submit pull-request
     - Move card on Trello
     - Add PR link to card
     - Alert team on Slack

   - Trello protocol

     - If a pair is working on it, it has your name on it
     - If it needs review, it has the reviewers name
     - If it has been reviewed and needs updating, it is in the Updating column
     - If you are the second reviewer and all is ok, accept & merge

   - During pairings, resolve challenges by:
     - Debugging and stuck on a 1 hour+ blocker? ask for help!
     - Need to chat about something? Write on Slack
     - Need to know the answer now? Directly join a pair with whom you‚Äôd like to discuss an urgent issue.
     - Cannot move on unless big issue is resolved as a team? Ask scrum master for help

6. **Stand-Up**

   - Voice roles for the day
   - Do any tasks need breaking down?
   - Prioritise
   - Estimate
   - Sprint backlog
   - Assign rand() pairs

7. **Retro**
   - What did we think would happen, what actually happened?
   - What went well, what could we do better tomorrow?
